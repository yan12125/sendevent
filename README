How to build:
(Linux) $ ndk-build
Theoretically works on Windows and Mac but not tested.
(Linux) $ adb push libs/armeabi/sendevent /data/local/tmp/

How to use:
0. Prerequisites
device $ getevent -t
Touch the screen and check which device file is the target, for example /dev/input/event0 on flame

1. Recording events
(Linux) $ adb shell getevent -t /dev/input/event0 > event_input.txt
Redirection in adb shell not working, don't know why

2. Replaying events
(Linux) $ adb push event_input.txt /data/local/tmp
(adb shell) $ cd /data/local/tmp
(adb shell) $ ./sendevent /dev/input/event0 event_input.txt

This tool requires root permission.
