How to build:
(Linux) $ ndk-build
Theoretically works on Windows and Mac but not tested.
(Linux) $ adb push libs/armeabi/sendevent /data/local/tmp/

How to use:
0. Prerequisites
device $ getevent -t
Touch the screen and check which device file is the target, for example /dev/input/event0 on flame

1. Recording events
(Linux) $ adb shell getevent -t /dev/input/event0 > event_input.txt
Redirection in adb shell not working, don't know why

2. Replaying events
(Linux) $ adb push event_input.txt /data/local/tmp
(adb shell) $ daemonize /data/local/tmp/sendevent /dev/input/event0 /data/local/tmp/event_input.txt
Now you can exit adb shell and unplug the USB cable. Events will be replayed when the power button is pressed.

Important:
1. This tool requires root permission.
2. (Linux) $ adb shell daemonize .... does not work (???)
